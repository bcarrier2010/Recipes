# Udon Noodle Soup

This recipe is great if you have a lot of random veggies laying around. I tend to throw in whatever sounds good. If the broth seems  little bland add a little more bouillon, if too salty/strong dilute with 1/4 cup water. This recipe can also be done vegetarian by omitting the egg and meat.  

### What you will need:
- 1 hard boiled egg halved
- 4 oz grilled tofu, chicken or beef sliced
- 1/4 cup broccoli
- About a 1/4 sliced onion
- 2 mushrooms sliced
- 3 baby carrots halved
- 1 green onion thinly chopped
- 1/2 teaspoon vegetable, chicken or beef bouillon
- 1 pack of udon noodles (I use the Fortune Brand)
- Spicy chili sauce to taste
- 2 cups water

### How to make it:
1. Fill medium sauce pan with 2 cups water and bring to a low boil.
2. Add broccoli, carrots, onion, udon noodle seasoning packet and bouillon. Boil until carrots are tender.
3. Add udon noodles and cook for 2 minutes.
4. Add mushrooms, green onion, and meat and cook for another 1-2 minutes.
5. Remove from heat. Split into two dishes each with an egg half. Add Chili sauce to taste. Serve immediately. Makes 2 servings.
