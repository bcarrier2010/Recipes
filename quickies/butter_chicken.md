# Instant Pot Butter Chicken
- 1 14oz can diced tomatoes
- 5-6 cloves garlic ( I used already minced garlic)
- 3 tsp minced ginger
- 1 tsp Tumeric
- 1/2 tsp Cayenne Pepper
- 1 tsp Paprika
- 1 tsp Salt (I'd say heaping tsp)
- 2 tsp Garam Masala
- 1 tsp Ground Cumin
- 1 lb boneless chicken thighs (you can do other cuts, just moister)
- 4 oz Butter (used kerigold)
- 4 oz Heavy Cream

### Notes
Recipe from here: https://twosleevers.com/instant-pot-butter-chicken/
Would recommend making a double batch

#### Instructions
See recipe above. I followed the instructions but did slight variations on the spice amounts.Tended to do heaping measurements since I prefer a more spiced dish.
