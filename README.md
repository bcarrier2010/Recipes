# Recipes
Collection of all my favorite recipies over the years and way to aggregate them into an easy to find library. There is also hope to turn these recipies into an ingredient findable database. That way when you're unsure what you'd like to eat you could say I want rice, and all recipies with rice will show up. I also will hopefully add a few other niceties as I build requirements. May make it something that I can plug into a raspberry pie smartboard.. Still figuring all that out though.

That is a ways down the road, and first I'd like to get all my recipies and go to meals in one place so I can develop the software based off my datasets.

Hope you enjoy some of the recipies until that point!
