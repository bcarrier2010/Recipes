# Recipes
This repository is a collection of some of my favorite recipes that have a little bit of a Britney spin on them.

### Why do I cook?
It always seems that food brings people together. I cook to bring people together over a dish they'll want to talk about and share with the people around them.

### What to expect
I tend to eyeball a lot of measurements, I usually cook solely to taste... So this will be a way for me to work on explaining what it is I am making as well as keep track of what I actually added to the dishes that are total winners. I'll also say the cooking temperatures will be accurate, however, the cook times will definitely vary from user to user. Also, I highly doubt you'll ever see a baked good appear in this repository. Well, maybe some bread, but cookies and cakes your out of luck. Sorry! I am the most horrible baker...
