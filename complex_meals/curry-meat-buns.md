# Curry Meat Buns

This recipe is super delicious and easy. It takes a little while because you have to wait for the bread to rise but it is so worth it. Beware, depending on they curry paste it could be a little spicy.

### What you will need:
- 1 pack of frozen dinner rolls (I usually use Rhodes brand)
- 1 small can or 1/4 cup yellow curry paste or your favorite
- 1 can cocoanut milk
- 5 small red potatoes chopped
- 1 lb. of tofu, chicken or beef either diced small or ground
- 1 carrot chopped
- 1/2 to 1 whole onion chopped
- 1 cup water
- 1 tablespoon veggie, chicken, or beef bouillon
- 1 tablespoon fish sauce
- 1 tablespoon soy sauce
- 2 tablespoons sesame oil

### How to make it:
1. Let bread dough defrost and rise, I usually follow the instructions on the package for this.
2. About halfway into the bread rise cycle, add sesame oil to a large frying pan on low heat.
3. Once oil is warm add tofu or meat, carrots, potatoes, onion, fish sauce and soy sauce. Cook until tender.
4. Add water, bouillon, cocoanut milk, and curry paste.
5. Cook until excess water has evaporated, curry should be thick.
6. Once thickened remove from heat and let cool.
7. Once the dough has risen fill with curry and reseal the dough ball.
8. Bake according to instructions of dinner roll packaging, I think its 350 degrees for 20-25 minutes.
